What works:

✅ | Wi-Fi
✅ | Ethernet
✅ | iGPU
✅ | Storage
❌ | No output (haven't patched yet, e.x VGA, HDMI)
✅ | Bluetooth
✅ | Keyboard
✅ | Trackpad
✅ | USBs
✅ | Audio
✅ | Camera
✅ | Brightness (and Brightness Keys)

### Note: This EFI is only really useful for the i3-7100U varient, I cannot test other methods and don't ask for support in places like r/Hackintosh or the main r/Hackintosh Discord Server. Thank you.

Download the EFI in the releases page if you want to test it out. Though I recommend the [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) to make your own EFI, as this is just for archival purposes.
