![file](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/713e4052-4a78-408c-a152-b47844e8b9d7)

### Note: This EFI is only really useful for the i3-7100U varient, I cannot test other methods and don't ask for support in places like r/Hackintosh or the main r/Hackintosh Discord Server. Thank you.

If you really want to download it, [Here](https://github.com/ducthoe/HP-Probook-450-G4-macOS-EFI/releases/tag/Release).

Specifications on my test system:

- CPU: i3-7100U
- RAM: 16gb 2133MHZ DDR4
- Audio: Contexant CX8200
- iGPU: Intel Integrated Graphics HD 620
- Wi-Fi: Intel Dual Band-AC 7265
- Storage 1: Intel SSDSCKJF180A5 SATA 180GB
- Storage 2: Intenso Sata III 256GB
- Ethernet: Realtek RTL8111 Ethernet

What works:

- ✅ | Wi-Fi
- ✅ | Ethernet
- ✅ | iGPU
- ✅ | Storage
- ❌ | No output (haven't patched yet, e.x VGA, HDMI)
- ✅ | Bluetooth
- ✅ | Keyboard
- ✅ | Trackpad
- ✅ | USBs
- ✅ | Audio
- ✅ | Camera
- ✅ | Brightness (and Brightness Keys)

Don't update to macOS Sequoia, since AirportItlwm has not updated yet, and the workaround that I tried, did not work. Sorry if you want window snapping.


Download the EFI in the releases page if you want to test it out. Though I recommend the [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) to make your own EFI, as this is just for archival purposes.
